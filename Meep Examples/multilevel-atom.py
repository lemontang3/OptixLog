# For defining laser properties in MEEP, the transition rates / frequencies are specified in units of 2*pi*a/c.
# gamma_21 in MEEP is the Full-Width Half-Max, as opposed to gamma_perp, which is the HWHM in SALT.
# Additionally, the classical coupling element sigma = 2*theta^2*omega_a/hbar, where
# theta is the off-diagonal dipole matrix element.

# These different conventions can cause a bit of confusion when comparing against SALT, so here we perform
# this transformation explicitly.

omega_a = 40  # omega_a in SALT
freq_21 = omega_a / (2 * math.pi)  # emission frequency  (units of 2œÄc/a)

gamma_perp = 4  # HWHM in angular frequency, SALT
gamma_21 = (2 * gamma_perp) / (
    2 * math.pi
)  # FWHM emission linewidth in sec^-1 (units of 2œÄc/a)
# Note that 2*pi*gamma_21 = 2*gamma_perp in SALT.

theta = 1  # theta, the off-diagonal dipole matrix element, in SALT
sigma_21 = 2 * theta * theta * omega_a  # dipole coupling strength (hbar = 1)

# The gain medium in MEEP is allowed to have an arbitrary number of levels, and is not
# restricted to a two-level gain medium, as it simulates the populations of every individual
# atomic energy level.

# If you are using a 2 level gain model, you can compare against
# results which only simulate the atomic inversion, using the definitions
# gamma_parallel = pumping_rate + rate_21
# D_0 = (pumping_rate - rate_21)/(pumping_rate + rate_21) * N0

# In fact, even if you arn't using a 2 level gain model, you can compare against an effective
# two level model using the formula provided in Cerjan et al., Opt. Express 20, 474 (2012).

# Here, D_0 as written above is not yet in "SALT" units. To make this conversion,
# D_0 (SALT) = theta^2/(hbar*gamma_perp) * D_0 (as written above)

# Finally, note the lack of 4*pi in the above conversion that is written in many published SALT papers.
# This 4*pi comes from using Gaussian units, in which the displacement field, D = E + 4*pi*P, whereas
# in SI units, D = eps0*E + P, which is what MEEP uses.

# Gain medium pump and decay rates are specified in units of c/a.

rate_21 = 0.005  # non-radiative rate  (units of c/a)
N0 = 37  # initial population density of ground state
Rp = 0.0051  # pumping rate of ground to excited state
# so for example, these parameters have D_0 (SALT) = 0.0693.
